## Why I am in this class?
Howdy,
In my research area, autonomous vehicle, I found an inmportant thing is to visualiza data. I want to learn some approaches in data visualization, so I could use it in my research project.

## A helpful data visualization
My recent research project is focus on visualize and simulate the autonomous vehicles and its environment. 
    In this context, we used a simulation tool for traffic simulation, called SUMO. It is able to 
    process road, traffic and vehicles data into visualization. Thus, I think it is a good
    example of data visualization.

Like illustrated in this link:[Import real road data into SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/OSMWebWizard.html)

![Good Example](/good_ex.jpeg =500x)

This is a good example, because it automate the process of processing data into simulation tool. 
    It can import the real-road data into a graphic visualization, then it could automatically add some cars in it to simulate traffics.

# A bad data visualization
Many bad or under-developed data visualization I have seen. Here is one example:

Link of bad example: [Cities with best Batting averages](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522)

The reason is that this is not really a graph in it. It has graphs of cities, but it
    did not really show the numbers to help visualize the data in it. Hence, I believe that 
    it is a bad example of data visualization.
