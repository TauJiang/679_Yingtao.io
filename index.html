<h2>Why am I in this class?</h2>
<p>Howdy, </p>
<p>In my research area, autonomous vehicles, I found an inmportant thing is to visualize data. I want to learn some approaches of data visualization, so I could use it in my research project.</p>

<h2>A helpful data visualization</h2>
<p>My recent research project is focus on visualize and simulate the autonomous vehicles and its environment. 
    In this context, we used a simulation tool for traffic simulation, called SUMO. It is able to 
    process road, traffic and vehicles data into visualization. Thus, I think it is a good
    example of data visualization.
</p>
<p>It is illustrated in this link:</p>
<a href="https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/OSMWebWizard.html">Import real road data into SUMO</a>
<p></p>
<img src="good_ex.jpeg" alt="good_ex" style="width:450px;height:350px;">
<p>This is a good example, because it automates the process of processing data into simulation tool. 
    It can import the real-road data into a graphic visualization, then it could automatically add some cars in it to simulate traffics.</p>

<h2>A bad data visualization</h2>
<p>Many bad or under-developed data visualizations I have seen. Here is one example:</p>
<img src="bad_ex.jpg" alt="bad_ex" style="width:450px;height:350px;">
<p></p>
<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522">Link of bad example: Cities with best Batting averages</a>
<p>The reason is that the graphs in it does not tell anything about data. It has graphs of cities, but it
    did not really show the numbers to help visualize the data in it. Hence, I believe that 
    it is a bad example of data visualization.
