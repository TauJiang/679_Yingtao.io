<p>Howdy, </p>
<p>In my research area, autonomous vehicle, I found an inmportant thing is to visualiza data. I want to learn some approaches in data visualization, so I could use it in my research project.</p>

<p>My recent research project is focus on visualize and simulate the autonomous vehicles and its environment. 
    In this context, we used a simulation tool for traffic simulation, called SUMO. It is able to 
    process road, traffic and vehicles data into visualization. Thus, I think it is a good
    example of data visualization.
</p>
<p>Like illustrated in this link:</p>
<a href="https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/OSMWebWizard.html">Import real road data into SUMO</a>
<p></p>
<img src="good_ex.jpeg" alt="good_ex" style="width:450px;height:350px;">
<p>This is a good example, because it automate the process of processing data into simulation tool. 
    It can import the real-road data into a graphic visualization, then it could automatically add some cars in it to simulate traffics.</p>

<p>Many bad or under-developed data visualization I have seen. Here is one example:</p>

<p></p>
<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/which-top-cricket-city-would-win-the-world-cup-1196522">Link of bad example: Cities with best Batting averages</a>
<p>The reason is that this is not really a graph in it. It has graphs of cities, but it
    did not really show the numbers to help visualize the data in it. Hence, I believe that 
    it is a bad example of data visualization.
